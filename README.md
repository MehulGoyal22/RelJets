# Recent Code Changes
1. Added a dot product condition to initialize the velocities only in a conical region.
2. Velocities in the conical region are faster.
3. Inside the conical region, the faster condition is implented through an increment to the vsub

# Further Plans
1. Add a radius dependent velocity initialization
